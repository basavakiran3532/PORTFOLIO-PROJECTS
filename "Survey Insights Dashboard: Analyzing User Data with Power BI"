"I recently completed a project focused on survey data analysis using Power BI.
In this project, I collected data from users through surveys, gathering various types of information. 
Subsequently, I utilized Power BI to create a comprehensive dashboard that visualizes and analyzes the collected data. 
The dashboard provides insights into key metrics, trends, and patterns derived from the survey responses, offering stakeholders a clear and intuitive understanding of the data. 
Through this project, I demonstrated proficiency in data collection, analysis, and visualization using Power BI, ultimately enabling informed decision-making based on the insights gained."
